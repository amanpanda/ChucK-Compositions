Here are some compositions I've composed over the years using the 
ChucK programming language. All tracks are written and composed 
by Aman Panda.

Compositions 0, 1, and 2 include .wav recordings of the compositions.
Compositions 3 and 4 require keyboard input from the user and hence
require the ChucK VM.
